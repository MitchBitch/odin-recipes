    <p>This pork fried rice recipe is my revised version of another recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped carrot</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped broccoli</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup cold cooked rice</li>
        <li>¼ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add pork, green onion, carrot, and broccoli; cook and stir until pork is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork mixture to a bowl and return skillet to medium heat</li>
        <li>Stir egg into the skillet and scramble until completely set. Add pork mixture back into the skillet; stir in rice, peas, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger. Cook and stir until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes</li>
    </ol>
